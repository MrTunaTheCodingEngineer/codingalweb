<p>The history of cars is more complicated than you would think, and the timeline stretches back to the <code> Late 1600s</code><br></p>

    Joseph Cugnot of France built what is said to be the first automobile in 1769.

    While his invention is recognized by the British Royal Automobile Club and the Automobile Club de France as being the first, many history books say that the automobile was invented by either Gottlieb Daimler or Karl Benz. This is because both Daimler and Benz invented highly successful and practical gasoline-powered vehicles that ushered in the age of modern automobiles. They invented cars that looked and worked like the cars we use today.
