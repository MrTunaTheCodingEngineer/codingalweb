<h1>chicken</h1>

<p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago.<br> Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.</br>

    Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<b>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]</b>

<h4>Reproduction and life-cycle</h4>
<i>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.[33]</i>
